# Bioinformatics - BIOL 5340 Fall 2024
The first half (Modules 1 and 2) of this class's homework was completed on a website called <a href="https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/">ROSALIND</a>, a platform for learning bioinformatics and bioinformatics tools through problem-solving. Modules 1 and 2 of this repository contain my solutions to the Rosalind problems. Each problem task is listed below for reference. Solutions to ROSALIND problems are curated using Python on Spyder, with packages like BioPython utilized for tools such as Seq.

### Module 1
- <b>Rosalind 1:</b> Variables and Some Arithmetic
- <b>Rosalind 2:</b> Strings and Lists
- <b>Rosalind 3:</b> Conditions and Loops
- <b>Rosalind 4:</b> Working with Files
- <b>Rosalind 5:</b> Dictionaries
- <b>Rosalind 6:</b> Counting DNA Nucleotides
- <b>Rosalind 7:</b> Transcribing DNA to RNA
- <b>Rosalind 8:</b> Translating RNA into Protein
- <b>Rosalind 9:</b> Computing GC Content

### Module 2
- <b>Rosalind 10:</b> Compute the Number of Times a Pattern Appears in a Text
- <b>Rosalind 11:</b> Find the Most Frequent Words in a String
- <b>Rosalind 12:</b> Implement PatternToNumber
- <b>Rosalind 13:</b> Implement NumberToPattern
- <b>Rosalind 14:</b> Generate the Frequency Array of a String
- <b>Rosalind 15:</b> Find All Occurrences of a Pattern in a String
- <b>Rosalind 16:</b> Find Patterns Forming Clumps in a String
- <b>Rosalind 17:</b> Find a Position in a Genome Minimizing the Skew
